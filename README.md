## Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb booking data, focusing on New York City. Using Python, the analysis uncovers insights into listing distribution, pricing, host behavior, customer reviews, and property availability. The project cleans and explores real Airbnb data, builds visualizations, and answers key business and market questions relevant to hosts, guests, and Airbnb stakeholders.

## Key Insights

- Entire home/apt listings are the most dominant in the NYC market.
- Significant variation exists in listing counts and average prices across neighborhood groups.
- Price is very strongly correlated with service fee.
- Host verification status has only a marginal effect on average review ratings.
- The number of listings a host has does not strongly predict the yearly availability of those listings.
- Hotel rooms tend to have the highest review rates in major neighborhoods.
